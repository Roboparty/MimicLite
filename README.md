# MimicLite

MimicLite is an efficient, general humanoid motion-tracking system that can train a deployable policy in 3 hours on 8 RTX 4090 GPUs while retaining competitive tracking quality. Under a matched MuJoCo evaluation, MimicLite improves global root tracking over SONIC while achieving comparable local tracking accuracy. The same policy supports low-latency Pico-driven teleoperation and highly dynamic motion tracking on a physical Unitree G1.

The technical report is available at [`mimic-lite.pdf`](mimic-lite.pdf).

## Released Checkpoints

The released checkpoint set contains three PPO policies trained for 4,000 iterations. The wall-clock column reports the 4,000-update training time on RTX 4090 GPUs. The tracking panels below evaluate the released checkpoints listed in the table.

| Policy | Actor hidden dimensions | Parallel environments | Checkpoint | Wall-clock time |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| MimicLite-Huge | `[1024, 1024, 1024]` | `32 × 8192` | [`xua2csee`](https://wandb.ai/elijahgalahad/mimic_lite/runs/xua2csee) | 3 h 30 min |
| MimicLite-Base | `[256, 256, 256]` | `8 × 8192` | [`iij0q0b5`](https://wandb.ai/elijahgalahad/mimic_lite/runs/iij0q0b5) | 2 h 57 min |
| MimicLite-Small | `[128, 128, 128]` | `4 × 8192` | [`zb9e19ih`](https://wandb.ai/elijahgalahad/mimic_lite/runs/zb9e19ih) | 3 h 00 min |

Training-time sources: Huge [`55ie49o5`](https://wandb.ai/elijahgalahad/mimic_lite/runs/55ie49o5), Base [`07k900hl`](https://wandb.ai/elijahgalahad/mimic_lite/runs/07k900hl), and Small [`akq50h1n`](https://wandb.ai/elijahgalahad/mimic_lite/runs/akq50h1n).

Compared with SONIC, MimicLite retains more progress on dynamic LAFAN motions and improves global root tracking while maintaining comparable local tracking accuracy.

## Training Data

Released training datasets are collected in the [`any4hdmi` Hugging Face collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/elijahgalahad/any4hdmi). The [`BONES-SEED` dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bones-studio/seed) is the exception: to respect its license and redistribution terms, users obtain it from the original source, while [`EGalahad/any4hdmi`](https://github.com/EGalahad/any4hdmi) provides only the conversion scripts and processing tools.

## Deployment Support

The [`sim2real`](https://github.com/EGalahad/sim2real) runtime provides a modular observation interface that separates policy-specific input construction from the shared deployment runtime. Integrating a policy requires only an observation class and a YAML specification; the inference, simulator, and robot interfaces remain unchanged. This common path supports integrated MuJoCo evaluation and real-robot execution for MimicLite, HEFT, TeleopIT, Humanoid-GPT, BFM-Zero, SONIC, and TWIST2. Policy inference is decoupled from robot I/O through interchangeable MuJoCo and physical Unitree G1 backends.
